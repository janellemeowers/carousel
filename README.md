# Creating a Carousel with Javascript

I wanted to practice creating a carousel with HTML/CSS and Javascript, as a way to do it without Bootstrap, and practice how the logic would work.

*This is a pretty simple example with 3 responsive slides and prev/next buttons. There is one 'Carousel' div that holds the "slide" divs.<br>
*The slides are absolute to the carousel parent, so that they stack on top of each other. <br>
*The display is simply then set to "none" as the buttons are pressed, which hides the current + moves to the next slide in the slide array.
